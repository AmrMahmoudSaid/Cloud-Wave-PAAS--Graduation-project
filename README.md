#### CLOUD WAVE is a gradation project which aims to build a [Platform as a Service](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-paas)  that simplifies the development, deployment, and management of various types of applications. Cloud Wave allows developers to focus on innovation while we handle the infrastructure and operational complexities.
#### Objectives Achieved:

ðŸ”§ Spring, Express, React, or General Application Management:

Seamlessly create and deploy applications by linking GitHub repositories or manually entering URLs.
Choose from various application plans (Basic, Pro, Super).
Easily add environment variables and expose ports as needed.
ðŸ’¾ Database Management:

Effortlessly create and configure MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB databases.
Select plans based on RAM, CPU, and memory requirements.
Define usernames, passwords, and root passwords with ease.

## How did we build it ?
#### We are using event driven microservices' architecture. 
## our technology stack:
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the main languages for all backend services
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) framework to handle http requests in the backend
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for database and [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) for ODM
- [Nats streaming server](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-streaming-server) as event bus and message queue -a little outdated but for our learning purposes it get the job done just like kafka for example-
- [Ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) for load balancing 
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerization
- [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for orchestration
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing
